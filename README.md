# Hr-Analytics-Employee Retention

## Project Purpose:

This project focuses on using data-driven insights to formulate effective strategies and recommendations to decrease employee attrition, thereby fostering a more engaged and productive workforce. 

## Project Details:

- High employee attrition rates were addressed through comprehensive analysis of HR data to identify key factors influencing attrition.
- The team collaboratively performed exploratory analysis using MySQL and Excel. BI tools such as Power BI and Tableau were utilized to create interactive visualizations and dashboards for reporting insights.
- Data-driven interventions were recommended and their impact on employee turnover was explored.

### Explored Metrics 

- Average attrition rate for all departments 
- Average hourly rate for Male Research Scientist 
- Attrition rate vs Monthly Income Stats 
- Average Working years for each Department 
- Job Role vs Work Life Balance
- Attrition rate vs Years since last promotion

### Analysis Results
- __Average attrition rate for all departments__ = The attrition rates across all departments are almost consistent throughout, hovering around the 50% mark. Research and Development might need some attention given they have the highest attrition rates.
- **Average hourly rate for Male Research Scientist** = The average hourly rate for a male research scientist is 114.4.
- **Attrition rate vs Monthly Income Stats** = The attrition rate does not vary significantly across different income ranges, staying around 50% around the overall rate. Higher income does not necessarily lead to lower attrition; in fact, the highest income range (>= $50K) has the highest attrition rate. The lowest attrition rates are found in the middle-income ranges ($10K-$20K and $30K-$40K), suggesting that extreme ends of the income spectrum might be more prone to attrition.
- **Average Working years for each Department** = The average total working years across different departments are quite close, indicating a relatively uniform experience level among employees across the organization.
- **Job Role vs Work Life Balance** = The work life balance values across all departments are quite good with average values hovering close to 2.5 out of a ranking of 4. 
- **Attrition rate vs Years since last promotion** = Within each department, the attrition rate hovers around 50%. But if we were to consider how much each department contributes to the overall attrition rate; then we can see that the younger talent (those who havenâ€™t been promoted since 0-5 years) contribute the highest to the overall attrition count. 


### Conclusions

- Specific attention is needed for the Research & Development department, which has the highest attrition rate. This may involve deeper investigation into department-specific challenges, such as job satisfaction, work environment, and career advancement opportunities.

- The consistent average total working years across departments indicate a uniform level of experience among employees across all departments. This consistency provides a strong foundation for cross-departmental training and development programs, which can be leveraged to enhance employee satisfaction and reduce attrition.

- The generally good work-life balance scores (around 2.5 out of 4) suggest that the organization is performing well in this area. However, continuous monitoring and improvement of work-life balance policies will be essential to maintain this positive trend and further reduce attrition rates.

- Younger employees and those who have not been promoted within the last 0-5 years are contributing significantly to the overall attrition rate. Additionally, the presence of employees who haven't received promotions in over 20+ years is a statistic that warrants attention. This underscores the need for targeted engagement strategies for all employees. Implementing mentorship programs, fast-track career paths, and regular feedback mechanisms can help retain the critical segment of young talent. For the senior employees, it is crucial to ensure that, despite the lack of recent promotions, they remain satisfied in their roles and are adequately compensated, considering their extensive experience.

- The data underscores the importance of a holistic approach to retention that encompasses financial rewards, career development, recognition, and work-life balance. Ensuring that all these aspects are addressed will likely result in a more satisfied and committed workforce, thereby reducing overall attrition rates.

### Recommendations
- **Conduct Exit Interviews**: To gain deeper insights into why employees leave, especially those in high-attrition departments and income brackets. 
- **Enhance Career Development Programs**: Focus on creating more opportunities for promotions and professional growth within the organization.
- **Regular Reviews of Compensation Packages**: Ensure that salary and benefits remain competitive but are also coupled with non-monetary rewards.
- **Employee Engagement Surveys**: Regularly assess employee satisfaction and engagement to identify potential issues early and address them proactively.
